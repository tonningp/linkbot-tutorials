(a) Write a Python program driveangle5.ch to driving a Linkbot-I forward by rotating both joints 1 and 3 for 720 degrees.
(b) Based on the setup on the RoboSim GUI described in Exercise 2 on page 50, run the program driveangle5.ch to simulate the motion of the robot in RoboSim.
(c) When the robot is moving in the RoboSim scene, press a key on the keyboard to pause the motion of the robot. Then, press a key to restart the motion.
(d) When the robot is moving in the RoboSim scene, press the ’t’ key to toggle the tracing of the robot trajectory. Press the ’n’ key to toggle the tgrid numbering.
